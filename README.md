# Operating System Project

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a simple functionality-limited operating system from scratch as a valuable learning experience. This project aims to provide basic operating system services and serve as a foundation to understand fundamental OS concepts.

## Features

- **File System**: Implement a file system to support read/write/update/delete operations for files and directories on a storage device.

- **Memory Management**: Develop memory management functionality with dynamic allocation and de-allocation of memory blocks.

- **Task Scheduling**: Implement task scheduling using lightweight processes and preemptive multitasking to efficiently manage system resources.

- **Device Drivers**: Create device drivers for essential components like the keyboard, mouse, video display, and hard disk.

- **Inter-Process Communication**: Implement message passing mechanisms between processes for efficient inter-process communication.

- **Modular Architecture**: Design a modular and layered architecture with a clear separation of concerns to enhance code maintainability.

- **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation covering design, architecture, algorithms, and data structures used in the operating system.

## Implementation

The operating system will be built from scratch in the C programming language on the x86 architecture, without relying on any existing operating systems for portability. Each module will be accompanied by unit tests to ensure its correctness.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, participants will have a solid understanding of core operating system concepts, including process management, memory management, file systems, scheduling algorithms, device drivers, kernel development, and system architecture. This hands-on experience will provide insight into the inner workings of operating systems at a basic implementation level.

## Outcome

This Operating System Project will not only provide practical experience in building an operating system from the ground up but will also empower participants to apply their newfound knowledge to more complex operating system challenges in the future.
