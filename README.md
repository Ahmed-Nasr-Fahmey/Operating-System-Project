# Operating-System-Project

Overview:
The goal of this project is to build a simple functionality-limited operating system from scratch as a learning experience. It will provide basic OS services and act as a foundation to understand fundamental OS concepts.

Features:

File system to support read/write/update/delete of files and directories in a storage device.

Memory management with allocation and de-allocation of memory blocks dynamically.

Task scheduling using lightweight processes and preemptive multitasking.

Device drivers for keyboard, mouse, video display and hard disk.

Message passing between processes for inter-process communication.

Modular and layered architecture with clear separation of concerns.

Documentation of design, architecture, algorithms and data structures.

Testing with unit tests for modules.

Implementation:
The OS will be built from scratch in C on x86 architecture without relying on any existing OS for portability. Modules will be unit tested.

Outcome:
Upon completion, students would have understood core OS concepts like process, memory and file management, scheduling algorithms, device drivers, kernel and system architecture at a basic implementation level.
